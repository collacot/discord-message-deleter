# discord-message-deleter

**-= Info:**
This program was made with Clickteam Fusion 2.5, and sometimes Windows or antiviruses scream that programs made in it are viruses. 
Rest assured, it is not a virus, Fusion 2.5 just fucking sucks. :thumbsup:

**-= How to Use:**
1. Open the program.
2. Have whatever DM/channel you want to remove your messages from open on Discord. Works either on the app or browser.
3. Press START in the program. 
4. Move back to that DM/channel and click in it or click a message in that DM. You have to make sure that the DM/channel is focused or else idfk what will happen lol
You are given a grace period of 10 seconds before it starts working.

After the 10 seconds are up, Cool Cat should start spinning and messages will start being deleted!
Please note, this is not an instant process and will take some time as it is manually deleting messages one by one. 
If you have thousands of messages in your chosen DM/channel, it could take hours to work. So, if you're in it for the long haul, time to go find something else to do!

**NOTE:** Make sure NOT to click out of that DM/channel until it is done or until you're happy with what was deleted.
If you want to stop the process, you can do so at any time by pressing STOP in the program or just close the program entirely.

**-= How it Works:**

It is simulating certain keystrokes in a repeated cycle. The program is quite dumb, as all it does is "presses" keys and spins Cool Cat. So, it can't tell what program you have focused. 
Meaning, if you click out of that DM or Discord, it will keep pressing those same keys until you stop it. It could do some wacky stuff in other programs besides Discord. 
It also won't hesitate to start deleting messages if you click to a different DM while it runs. The program has no bias, racism, homophobia, or prejudice. All it knows is the 5 or so keypresses to delete a message and what order to do them in.

If you're curious about how long it might take, I measured the time for one message to be deleted to be about 1.3 seconds. So that means if you have, lets say 12,342 messages for example, it will take about 16,045 seconds. That's about 4 and a half hours. Sheesh! Told you it would take a while.

Also, I think this program is *technically* against Discord TOS, but I'm not sure how well this would be enforced. Read over this article and make your own judgment calls: https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/115002192352-Automated-User-Accounts-Self-Bots

Now if you don't care about the TOS, go kill 'em tiger!

Have fun!
